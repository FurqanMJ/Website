	<p>The <b>Lotus Temple</b> in New Delhi is not only an architectural marvel but also a symbol of unity. A mind-blowing fact about the temple is that it has no idols, altars, or religious symbols, welcoming people of *all faiths and beliefs* to meditate and reflect in silence. Its unique design, inspired by the lotus flower, features **27 free-standing marble "petals"** arranged in clusters of three, creating nine sides—a structure that appears to float like a blooming lotus. 

        Even more fascinating, this Bahá'í House of Worship is one of the <b>most visited buildings in the world</b>, often surpassing iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Taj Mahal in annual footfall!</p>
