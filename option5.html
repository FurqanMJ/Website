	<p><b>Hampi</b>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India, was once the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire and is filled with architectural marvels. A mind-blowing fact is that the *stone chariot* in the Vittala Temple complex, which appears to have wheels, was designed so realistically that they could once rotate. Although now fixed to preserve it, the craftsmanship remains unparalleled.

        A <b>unique fact</b> about Hampi is its musical pillars at the Vittala Temple. When struck, these stone pillars emit different musical notes, resembling sounds of traditional instrumentsâ€”a remarkable blend of art, science, and acoustics from ancient times!</p>
