        <br>The <b>Qutub Minar</b>, at 72.5 meters, is the tallest brick minaret in the world. Its construction began in 1193 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak and was completed by Iltutmish and later rulers.
    </br>
            </br><b>Unique Fact:</b>  
            The Qutub Minar has survived multiple earthquakes over centuries. Its slightly tilted structure is due to repairs made during the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq, showcasing ancient engineering skills that combined stability with resilience.</p>
